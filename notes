For this region, give me the 10 plants that would maximize the number of interactions (regardless of the species). Or something like this

For this region, give me the 10 plants that would maximize the number of interactions (the higher diversity too)

BC biogeoclimatic zone designations - Gary oak ecosystem is CDF (coastal douglas fair ecosystem)
CWH here
Oakanagan - Ponderosa Pine 

What is bombus occidentalis using 


For sorting
we want to plant shrubs or we can't do anything woody

<<<<<<< HEAD
Break up the alphabetical list into bees, wasps, flies

- colour plants by native or non-native
- early- mid or late bloomer for the home gardeners (for everybody)
- blooming at the same time as blueberry has been shown to be food for diversity of forage
  - increase diversity of

Filter by number of interactions

Dataframe task: add biogeoclimatic regions, add plant Nat Vs Inv, add plant type, pollinators stating B, W, or F
   Breaking it into native vs not. (or to colour to indicate)
   Woody vs forbs
